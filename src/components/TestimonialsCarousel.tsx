      text: "Emanuel Smith was my Dean in high school from 2014-2017, but luckily, I had the pleasure of meeting him before then in 2013. Due to my wonderful & at times class clown of a brother, Smith took on a role of a Mentor / Father in-school & outside. Example, During my time in high school had seizures, I was disobedient & very irresponsible. Smith stuck it out with me through thick & thin. He gave me rides home when my mom was working overtime to make ends meet or when I didn't have bus fare, he always made sure that I was fed and overall taught me better ways to live life .",

I had been praying hard for help, and God answered through Mr. Smith. He didn't just talk to my son; he listened to him and took him places, playing basketball, and most importantly, showing him what it means to be a good and decent man. Mr. Smith was more than just a mentor. My son really didn't have a father figure or a man in his life to teach him how to be one, so Mr. Smith filled the gap.",
